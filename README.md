Early proof of concept/prototype for a W3C WebDriver client
based in only node.js - only binaries needed are the browser
& its driver.

Mainly working with geckodriver as that seems to have more
support & is under active development.

Firefox needs to be in your PATH in order to run the example.

> node example.js

Attempting to combine the simplicity of Casper/Phantom/Slimer
with the stability & practicality of Selenium.
